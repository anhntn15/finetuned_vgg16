# Applied Deep Learning on Image Classification
This project is a part of my bachelor's thesis. Since it was done in 2016, many details are lost :(
  - Fine-tuned VGG-16 model on personal image dataset.
  - Deployed classification model on an image recognition application (Android device).

Tech stack:
  - model: VGG-16
  - deep learning framework: Caffe 2
  - application: Java, TCP/Socket
